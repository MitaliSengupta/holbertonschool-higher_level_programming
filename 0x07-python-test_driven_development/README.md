# Python - Test Driven Development

## What you should learn from this project

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
- What’s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using wc
- All test files should be inside a folder tests
- All test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
- All modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')

## Project
- Write a function that adds 2 integers.
- Write a function that divides all elements of a matrix.
- Write a function that prints “My name is ”.
- Write a function that prints a square with the character #.
- Write a function that prints a text with 2 new lines after each of these characters: ., ? and :
- Since the beginning you are creating “Interactive tests”. For this exercise, you will add Unittests. In this task, you will write unittests for the function def max_integer(list=[]):.
- Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices:
- Write a function that multiplies 2 matrices by using the module NumPy
