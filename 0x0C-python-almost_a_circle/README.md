## 0x0C Python - Almost a circle

## Project
- All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated.
- Write the first class Base
- Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base
- Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation (id excluded)
- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.
- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def display(self): that prints in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # - you donâ€™t need to handle x and y here.
- Update the class Rectangle by overloading the __str__ method that returns [Rectangle] (<id>) <x>/<y> - <width>/<height>
- Update the class Rectangle by improving the public method def display(self): to print in stdout the Rectangle instance with the character # by taking care of x and y
- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def update(self, *args): that assigns an argument to each attribute
- Update the class Rectangle by updating the public method def update(self, *args): by changing the prototype to update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns a key/value argument to attributes
- Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle
- Update the class Square by adding the public getter and setter size
- Update the class Square by adding the public method def update(self, *args, **kwargs) that assigns attributes
- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Rectangle
- Update the class Square by adding the public method def to_dictionary(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Square
- Update the class Base by adding the static method def to_json_string(list_dictionaries): that returns the JSON string representation of list_dictionaries
- Update the class Base by adding the class method def save_to_file(cls, list_objs): that writes the JSON string representation of list_objs to a file
- Update the class Base by adding the static method def from_json_string(json_string): that returns the list of the JSON string representation json_string
- Update the class Base by adding the class method def create(cls, **dictionary): that returns an instance with all attributes already set
- Update the class Base by adding the class method def load_from_file(cls): that returns a list of instances
