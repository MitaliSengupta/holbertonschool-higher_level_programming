# Python - Classes and Objects

## What you should learn from this project

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #pythoniscool :))
- What is OOP
- “first-class everything”
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
- What is self
- What is a method
- What is the special __init__ method and how to use it
- What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- How to bind attributes to object and classes
- What is and what does contain __dict__ of a class and of an instance of a class
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
- How to use the getattr function

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using wc
- All modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
